Since 2019, I work as an assistant professor at the [Julius Center](https://juliuscentrum.umcutrecht.nl/en) of the University Medical Center Utrecht. I conducted my [PhD research](https://limo.libis.be/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=LIRIAS2837094&context=L&vid=Lirias&search_scope=Lirias&tab=default_tab&fromSitemap=1) "From Text to Time: Machine Learning Approaches to Temporal Information Extraction from Text" at the [LIIR Research Lab](https://liir.cs.kuleuven.be/) of the Computer Science Department, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, together with [Prof. dr. Marie-Francine Moens](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~sien.moens/). 

My general topics of research include: machine learning, clinical prediction models, and natural language processing.
