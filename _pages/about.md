Biography
Since 2019, I work as an assistant professor at the Julius Center of the University Medical Center Utrecht. I conducted my PhD research "From Text to Time: Machine Learning Approaches to Temporal Information Extraction from Text" at the LIIR Research Lab of the Computer Science Department, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, together with Prof. dr. Marie-Francine Moens. 

My general research includes: machine learning, clinical prediction models, and natural language processing.
